We value your trust and we work hard to keep your data safe. This page explains our rules for your information.

## Information We Collect
We only save the data we need to make the bot work. This includes your Discord user ID and the IDs of the servers where you use the bot. We also keep track of your commands and your card collection. We store your inventory and trade history and your profile card settings. If you upload an image for your profile card we save that image too. We do not look at or save any other data.

## How We Use Your Data
We use your information to run the bot and to provide your card collection. We also use it to find and fix bugs. This helps us make the bot faster and better for everyone.

## Data Sharing
We never sell your data. We do not share your personal information with other companies. We only share data if the law requires it.

## How We Keep Data Safe
We use strong security tools to protect your account. We store your data on private servers that are locked and protected. Only the main developer can see the database.

## How Long We Keep Data
We keep your collection and profile as long as you use the bot. If you do not use the bot for two years we delete your data. We only keep a simple count of total commands used. This count does not include your username or your ID.

## Your Control and Deletion
You can stop using the bot whenever you want. If you ask us to delete your data we will remove everything within 3 weeks.

## Changes to This Policy
We will send a message in our official Discord server if we change these rules. We will also update the date at the top of this page when we do.

## Contact Us
Please reach out if you have questions or if you want to delete your data.
