## Acceptance of These Terms

By using Blair bot you agree to follow all the rules on this page. If you do not agree with these rules you must stop using the bot and leave our Discord server. Continued use of the bot means you accept any future updates we make to these terms.

## User Rules and Restrictions

You agree to follow these rules to keep the game fair for everyone. We have a zero tolerance policy for cheating.

* You will not use multiple accounts to collect extra cards, rewards or any currency.
* You will not use any automated scripts or macros or self bots to play the game.
* You will not trade bot items or cards for real money or other outside currencies.
* You will not attempt to scrape or steal data from our database.
* You will not use the bot to harass or scam other players.

## Virtual Items and Currency

All cards and items and currencies in the bot are virtual. They have no real world value and cannot be exchanged for cash. We own all the data and code that makes up these items. We can change or remove items at any time to keep the game balanced. If you are banned for breaking the rules you lose access to all your virtual items.

## Bug Bounties and Exploits

If you find a bug or a way to get items unfairly you must report it to the ticket channel immediately. You must not share the bug with other players. We may offer a bug bounty in the form of in game rewards for helpful reports. The developer decides the amount of the reward. We can refuse to give a reward if the bug was already known or if you used the bug to your advantage first.

## Account Responsibility

You are the only person responsible for what happens on your Discord account. If a friend or family member uses your account to break the rules we will still ban the account. We do not accept excuses about any shared accounts. Please keep your login details safe.

## Service and Updates

We provide this bot for free and as a hobby project. There is only one developer so we do not guarantee the bot will be online every day. We can stop providing the service at any time without notice. We are not responsible if you lose progress due to a technical error or a server crash.

## Age Requirement

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Blair bot. This is to follow the rules set by Discord. If we learn that a user is under 13 we will delete their data and ban them from the service.

## User Generated Content

You might be able to upload images or text to the bot for your profile and other commands. You are the only one responsible for what you upload. You must not upload anything that is illegal or hateful or breaks the rules of Discord. We have the right to remove any content you upload without asking you first. By uploading content you give us the right to show it to other users as part of the bot's features.

## Ownership of the Bot

We own all the code and the card frame art and the brand assets for the Blair bot. You are not allowed to copy or remix or sell any part of the bot. You cannot use our name or our assets to make your own project without our written permission. This includes the specific way we designed our card game and our unique features.

## Termination of Access

We have the right to ban any user for any reason. We usually only do this when someone breaks the rules but we keep the right to protect our community. If you are banned you may not create a new account to bypass the ban.

## Appeals and Final Authority

The developer has the final say in all disputes. If you feel a ban was unfair you can send one appeal through a support ticket. We will look at your case and make a decision. Once we make that final decision you must respect it. We will not engage in long debates about the rules and we will not tolerate harassment of our staff over a ban.

## Limitation of Liability

The bot is provided as it is. We are not responsible for any issues or damages that happen from your use of the bot. This includes any data loss or disagreements with other users.

## Contact and Support

If you have questions about these rules please email blair@collector.org. You can also open a support ticket in our official Discord server.
