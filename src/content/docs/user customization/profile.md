Create your **profile** if you have not, using the `bprofile` command, (e.g. `bpro`).

> Currently there is **no** default profile card, but soon support will be added for default preset selections.

:::note

Your profile is visible and searchable by others. Special letters in name etc does not have good support yet but this is a good site to find special fonts for text: https://lingojam.com/FancyTextGenerator

### Examples

```sh
bprofile
```


**Do**:

- `bpro` (shows your profile card)
- `bprofile @seth` (shows seth's profile card)
- `bp 1889274628819` (shows profile card for that user id)

**Don't**:

- `Bpro sethyl` (does not support username searching)
- Use offensive or long names.
